# Real-Time-Face-Recognition-for-Attendance

This Face detection and recognition project is a Python-based application that leverages the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to identify and verify human faces. It efficiently detects faces in real-time using a webcam or pre-recorded images, recognizes known individuals from a pre-trained dataset, and processes data for various applications like authentication and attendance systems.
